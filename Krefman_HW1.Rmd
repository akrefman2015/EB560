This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
hw1data <- read.csv("~/Dropbox/School/Winter 2015/Consulting/hw1data.csv")
catVars <- c("group", "sex", "race")
myVars <- c("group", "sex", "race", "age", "weight", "height")
library(tableone)
tab3 <- CreateTableOne(vars = myVars, strata = "group" , data = hw1data, factorVars = catVars)
tab3
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
